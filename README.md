💻 Industrial Training (SIWES) – Front-End Web Development
👨‍🎓 About Me
My name is Nnadi Samson Onyebuchi, a 300-level Computer Science student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I used my 6-month Industrial Training (SIWES) to dive deep into front-end web development — focusing on mastering the core technologies used in building modern web applications.

🎯 My Training Goal
I divided the training into two major phases:

Months 1–2: Intensive learning of front-end fundamentals

Months 3–6: Hands-on practice, project building, and application of everything I learned

The overall goal was to become confident in building, styling, and deploying responsive front-end applications — and connecting them to APIs, including those written in Python.

📅 Learning Timeline
🔹 Month 1 – Core Web Skills
HTML & CSS fundamentals

Flexbox and Grid layouts

Responsive design with media queries

JavaScript programming basics (variables, loops, functions, arrays)

DOM manipulation and working with forms

🔹 Month 2 – React & API Integration
Setting up React projects (using Vite or CRA)

JSX, components, props, and useState

Fetching data from public APIs using fetch and useEffect

Styling with Tailwind CSS

GitHub for version control

Deployment using Netlify and Vercel

🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Used
Category	Tools / Tech
Languages	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Libraries	React, Tailwind CSS
APIs	REST APIs 
Tools	VS Code, GitHub

📌 What I Learned
By the end of this training, I became confident in:

Writing clean, responsive HTML and CSS

Building interactive features with JavaScript

Creating reusable components with React

Fetching data from external APIs and displaying it dynamically

Using Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive UI design

Hosting my projects online and managing my code with GitHub

✅ Final Reflection
This Industrial Training gave me the time and structure to move from basic understanding to real-world application. I can now confidently build front-end applications, connect them to APIs, and deploy them — skills I will continue to sharpen as I work on more complex projects in the future.

I’m grateful for this experience and excited to continue growing as a front-end developer.
